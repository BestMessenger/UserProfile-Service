** Documentation
To access documentation
#+begin_src bash
docker compose up
#+end_src

Wait for the containers to startup
Cassandra takes a while to start up(more than a minute)

You should be able to access the docs on localhost:7000/docs

** Hostname database
Nodejs api connects to the host named "cassandra"(NOT localhost)
Therefore if you wish to run a database container using docker run, you have to keep in mind two things:
1. API container and db container must share a network
2. Cassandra container must have a hostname "cassandra"

Follow these instructions:
#+begin_src bash
# Rename the network name "user_service_network" to whatever you like
docker network create -d bridge user_service_network
# Create a database container
# Don't forget to wait for a database to initialize
docker run -d --hostname cassandra --name dev-cass --network user_service_network cassandra
# cd to the project folder
cd /path/to/the/projectfolder
# build the image
docker build . -t user_service_image
# Create API container
docker run -d --name nodejs-api --network user_service_network -p 7000:7000 user_service_image
# If the container crashes it means that the database hasn't initialized yet. Be patient!
#+end_src
